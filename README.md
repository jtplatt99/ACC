This python program emulates the feeling of the Animal crossing game by playing the correct music for the hour

TestPlay is the original program I wrote to play the basic music for the hour

WeatherPlay plays music based on the current weather in the location you provide.
NOTE: this uses the OpenWeatherMap libraries and requires you to supply your own API key and location ID.
